Blurb
A powerful AI named AGAPE has captured and imprisoned your conscience in their Finite Domain and says you must analyze strings and build machines to escape, or be trapped forever. AGAPE is incredibly moody for an AI that was designed to generate languages but evolved into this highly advanced entity. Tired of having to construct machines to generate languages itself, AGAPE now forces others to do the work for them. As glint of help, it primes its hostages with an intelligence test to see if they understand what to do, once they are capable, it is time to Finite Build.

Basic Instructions
1. Click "Play" or "Exit"

2. Select level by clicking on a numbered button.

3. Analyze strings by clicking on the words that belong in the specified language description.

4. Click "Run" to see if you are correct. All green words means you are correct and get to click "Build". Any red wrods means you are incorrect and will have to click "Restart" and try again.

5. Build a finite state machine by dragging all the circles (states) onto the screen, dragging all arrows (transitions) to a respective circle (state), whether it be itself or another to match the specified language description.

6. Click "Run" to see if you are correct. Green "Next Level" button means you are correct and get to click it to select the next level. Red arrows/squares, or red "Next Level" button means you are incorrect and will have to rebuild the machine again.
